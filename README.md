# Spanish-Naming-Tenses-Replacer
This program renames a select few Spanish tense names in Wiktionary (Es) according to my personal reworking of them

## Introduction/Context

I personally have some disputes with how certain Spanish tenses are named, and as per my own personal reworking of them in order to help me understand and learn the language faster, it would be convenient for me to apply these changes to the websites which I do reference for Spanish conjugation (i.e. exclusively Wiktionary in Spanish). Since it would be a shame for all this work to go to waste, I'll be publishing it here for others if they also want to adopt my system. Enjoy!
